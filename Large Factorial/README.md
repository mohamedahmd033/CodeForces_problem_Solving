Problem: making a function to take an int number and return its factorial which is very large to be fitted in an int or long long dataType.

There are two functions to solve this problem:

1- largeFactorial: The function takes the magnitude of an int number and return vector contains the result value digits.
the digit in index 0 of the vector is the least digit (ones place), while the digit in index 1 is tens place.. etc

2- displayFactorialVector: it takes a vector and print its content from the last index to the first index
